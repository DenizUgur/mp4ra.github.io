					<p>In order to apply for an identifier to be registered, you must abide by the following terms established by ISO. (Note that RID stands for &quot;registered identifier&quot;, a code-point in this case).</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font size="-1">The party requesting a format identifier shall:</font></p>
						<ol>
							<li type="a"><font size="-1">apply using the Form and procedures supplied by the Registration Authority;</font>
							<li type="a"><font size="-1">include a description of the purpose of the registered identifier, and the required technical details as specified in the application form;</font>
							<li type="a"><font size="-1">provide contact information describing how a complete description can be obtained on a non-discriminatory basis;</font>
							<li type="a"><font size="-1">agree to institute the intended use of the granted RID within a reasonable time frame; and</font>
							<li type="a"><font size="-1">to maintain a permanent record of the application form and the notification received from the Registration Authority of a granted RID.</font>

					<p>To register a code-point with this registration authority, please send email to <em>mp4reg</em> at <em>group.apple.com</em> (we regret the lack of a hyperlink, and the &quot;@&quot; sign, but this is so that spammers' web crawlers will not find the address easily).</p>
					<p>The subject of the email <em>must</em> include the word &quot;mp4reg&quot; somewhere. <strong>Messages without &quot;mp4reg&quot; in their subject may be discarded as spam and never seen or acted on by a human.</strong></p>
					<p>In the body of the email, please identify:</p>
					<ol>
						<li type="1">The name, address, and URL of the organization requesting the code-point.
						<li type="1">The kind of code-point you wish to register (please choose from the set of registered types).
						<li type="1">For all except object-type registrations, the suggested identifier (four-character code). Note that four-character codes use four 8-bit printable characters, usually from the first 128 Unicode characters (commonly thought of as plain ASCII), but at most from the first 256 Unicode characters.
						<li type="1">The specification in which this code-point is defined, if possible. A copy of the specification would be appreciated, as it enables the authority to understand the registration better. If you are requesting a 'codec' code-point, a reference to the definition of the coding system itself, if separate from the definition of its storage in these files, would also be appreciated.
						<li type="1">A brief 'abstract' of the meaning of the code-point, perhaps ten to twenty words (see examples on this site).
						<li type="1">Contact information for an authorized representative for the code-point, including:
							<ol>
								<li type="1">Contact person's name, title, and orgaanization.
								<li type="1">Contact email.
								<li type="1">Contact telephone number, and fax number if available.
								<li type="1">Contact physical address (street address), if applicable.
							</ol>
						<li type="1">Date of definition or implementation (if known) or intended date (if in future).
						<li type="1">Statement of an intention to apply (implement) the assigned code-point.
					</ol>
					<p>Applications with insufficient information, detail, or documentation, may be returned by the registration authority for clarification. Please be as complete and clear as possible.</p>
					<p>Items 1 through 5 will be published on the authority's web site. The remaining items are kept for the authority's records only, and are not published.</p>
					<p>If your suggested code-point is already in use, or the authority considers that the suggested value is unsuitable or may be misleading, the authority may suggest an alternative value.</p>
