# Request registration

## ISO Registration

(see [below](#quicktime-registration) for QuickTime registration)

In order to apply for an identifier to be registered, you must abide by the following terms established by ISO. (Note that RID stands for "registered identifier", a code-point in this case).

The party requesting a format identifier shall:

1.  apply using the Form and procedures supplied by the Registration Authority;
2.  include a description of the purpose of the registered identifier, and the required technical details as specified in the application form;
3.  provide contact information describing how a complete description can be obtained on a non-discriminatory basis;
4.  agree to institute the intended use of the granted RID within a reasonable time frame; and
5.  to maintain a permanent record of the application form and the notification received from the Registration Authority of a granted RID.

If your suggested code-point is already in use, or the authority considers that the suggested value is unsuitable or may be misleading, the authority may suggest an alternative value.

There are two distinct methods for submitting a registration request. Regardless of the submission method, an issue along with an associated pull request will be opened in [the repository](https://github.com/mp4ra/mp4ra.github.io/issues) to track and manage the registration request process.

### Issue Template Submission Method

Registration requests can be initiated by using the specifically designed [issue template](https://github.com/mp4ra/mp4ra.github.io/issues/new?template=new-codepoint-iso.yml).
The issue template includes a series of mandatory fields that must be filled out to process the request. Additionally, optional fields are provided for supplementary information.

**Note**: Given the public nature of GitHub, any sensitive information, particularly contact details, should not be disclosed directly in the issue if the requester opts for privacy. In such cases, leave these fields blank and send an email to `mp4reg [at] group.apple.com` with that information including the link to the issue you created.

### Alternative Email Submission Method

As an alternative to the issue template, requests can be formally sent via email to `mp4reg [at] group.apple.com` using the following:

<details>
<summary>Email submission form</summary>

1. The name, address, and URL of the organization requesting the code-point.
1. The kind of code-point you wish to register (please choose from the set of registered types).
1. For all except object-type registrations, the suggested identifier (four-character code). Note that four-character codes use four 8-bit printable characters, usually from the first 128 Unicode characters (commonly thought of as plain ASCII), but at most from the first 256 Unicode characters.
1. The specification in which this code-point is defined, if possible. A copy of the specification would be appreciated, as it enables the authority to understand the registration better. If you are requesting a 'codec' code-point, a reference to the definition of the coding system itself, if separate from the definition of its storage in these files, would also be appreciated.
1. A brief 'abstract' of the meaning of the code-point, perhaps ten to twenty words (see examples on this site)
1. Contact information for an authorized representative for the code-point, including:
    - Contact person's name, title, and orgaanization.
    - Contact email.
    - Contact telephone number, and fax number if available.
    - Contact physical address (street address), if applicable.
1. Date of definition or implementation (if known) or intended date (if in future).
1. Statement of an intention to apply (implement) the assigned code-point.

</details>

Please make sure to include `mp4reg` in the subject of your email.

Applications with insufficient information, detail, or documentation, may be returned by the registration authority for clarification. Please be as complete and clear as possible.

Items 1 through 5 will be published on the authority's web site. The remaining items are kept for the authority's records only, and are not published.

## QuickTime Registration

Please note that Apple Inc. owns and defines the QuickTime file format, and Apple Inc. makes no promise or undertaking to accept applications, and the definition and use of codes in the QuickTime file format are at Apple's sole discretion. If your suggested code-point is already in use, or Apple considers that the suggested value is unsuitable, may be misleading, or is otherwise inappropriate, the authority may suggest an alternative value or refuse the registration, at its sole discretion.

Note that codes using only lower-case letters are reserved to Apple.
